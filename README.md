## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: Trauma victims are able to surf the web without having to worry about coming across potential trauma triggers.
- REALITY: Given the volume of unfiltered, untagged information uploaded onto the Internet and the nature of the modern web browsing experience, trauma victims can be inadvertently exposed to trauma triggers without warning. 
- CONSEQUENCES: Trauma victims may have unwanted emotional reactions to trauma triggers on the internet, possibly worsening their mental state and reopening the wounds of trauma.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
PreCursor is a web browser for victims of trauma that considers the presence of trauma triggers on the Internet. Victims of trauma (or their therapist(s)) can provide PreCursor specific words and concepts that could cause a trauma-based reaction in the user, and PreCursor will provide the user AI-based warnings and filtering of webpages and their content based on the user's needs. Overall, this limits the potential for triggering content to be consumed inadvertently, and provides the user sufficient warning to consume the potentially triggering content in a prepared state of mind.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if 
appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve 
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development 
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.
