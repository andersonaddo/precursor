## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
- IDEAL: Trauma victims are able to surf the web without having to worry about coming across potential trauma triggers.
- REALITY: Given the volume of unfiltered, untagged information uploaded onto the Internet and the nature of the modern web browsing experience, trauma victims can be inadvertently exposed to trauma triggers without warning. 
- CONSEQUENCES: Trauma victims may have unwanted emotional reactions to trauma triggers on the internet, possibly worsening their mental state and reopening the wounds of trauma.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
PreCursor is a web browser for victims of trauma that considers the presence of trauma triggers on the Internet. Victims of trauma (or their therapist(s)) can provide PreCursor specific words and concepts that could cause a trauma-based reaction in the user, and PreCursor will provide the user AI-based warnings and filtering of webpages and their content based on the user's needs. Overall, this limits the potential for triggering content to be consumed inadvertently, and provides the user sufficient warning to consume the potentially triggering content in a prepared state of mind.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve 
in the future.
